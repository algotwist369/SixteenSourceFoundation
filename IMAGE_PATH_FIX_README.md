# 🖼️ Image Path Fix for Hostinger Deployment

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Problem: Images Not Visible After Deployment

**Root Cause:** Incorrect image paths that work locally but fail in production on Hostinger.

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Hero Carousel Images (`hero.json`)
**Before (Wrong):**
```json
"image": "public/assets/GalleryImg/13.jpeg"
```

**After (Correct):**
```json
"image": "/assets/GalleryImg/13.jpeg"
```

- ✅ Removed `public/` prefix
- ✅ Added leading `/` for absolute path
- ✅ Using images 13, 14, 15 for hero slides

---

### 2. Page Header Images (`pageHeaders.json`)
**Before (Wrong):**
```json
"/public/assets/GalleryImg/16.jpeg"
```

**After (Correct):**
```json
"/assets/GalleryImg/16.jpeg"
```

- ✅ All page headers now use local gallery images
- ✅ Removed Unsplash dependencies
- ✅ Faster loading times

---

### 3. Gallery Images (`homeData.json` & `galleryData.json`)
**Before (Wrong):**
```json
"/public/assets/GalleryImg/1.jpeg"
```

**After (Correct):**
```json
"/assets/GalleryImg/1.jpeg"
```

- ✅ All 16 gallery images updated
- ✅ Unique IDs assigned (1-16)
- ✅ Descriptive titles for SEO

---

### 4. Training Course Posters (`trainingData.json`)
**Correct Paths:**
```json
"image": "/assets/Courses/poster1.jpeg"
"image": "/assets/Courses/poster2.jpeg"
```

- ✅ Using real course posters
- ✅ Both beauty parlour course posters configured

---

## 📂 Correct Folder Structure

```
frontend/
└── public/
    └── assets/
        ├── Courses/
        │   ├── poster1.jpeg
        │   └── poster2.jpeg
        ├── GalleryImg/
        │   ├── 1.jpeg
        │   ├── 2.jpeg
        │   └── ... (up to 16.jpeg)
        ├── logo/
        │   ├── favicon.jpeg
        │   └── mainlogo.jpeg
        └── teams/
            └── (team member photos)
```

## 🎯 Path Rules for Hostinger Deployment

### ✅ DO Use:
- `/assets/folder/image.jpeg` - Absolute path from public folder
- Always start with `/` for absolute paths
- Use exact case-sensitive file names

### ❌ DON'T Use:
- `/public/assets/...` - Don't include `public/` in path
- `/src/assets/...` - Source paths won't work in production
- `public/assets/...` - Missing leading slash
- External URLs (if blocked by CORS or firewall)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Hostinger:

- [x] All image paths start with `/assets/`
- [x] No `/public/` or `/src/` prefixes
- [x] File names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- [x] Images exist in `public/assets/` folder
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Test locally with `npm run build` and `npm run preview`

---

## 🧪 Testing in Production

After deployment, check:

1. **Hero carousel** - All 3 slides show images
2. **Gallery section** - All gallery images load
3. **Training courses** - Course posters display
4. **Page headers** - Header images on all pages
5. **Program cards** - Initiative images visible

---

## 💡 Why This Works

When Vite builds your app:
- Everything in `public/` folder → copied to build root
- `public/assets/image.jpg` → becomes `/assets/image.jpg` in production
- References like `/assets/...` → point to correct location on server

---

## 🆘 If Images Still Don't Show

Check:

1. **File permissions on server** - Should be 644 for images
2. **MIME types** - Server should serve .jpeg as image/jpeg
3. **Case sensitivity** - Linux servers are case-sensitive
4. **File upload** - Ensure all images uploaded to Hostinger
5. **Path in browser** - Check Network tab for 404 errors
