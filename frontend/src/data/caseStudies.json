            "content": "Sapna, a 23-year-old from Chembur in Mumbai, grew up in a large joint family and considers Mumbai to be her home. Growing up with so many family members was a fun experience for her until her father, the sole breadwinner of the family and owner of a successful business, passed away. This loss was a major shock for the family and resulted in her mother separating from the family with her two younger brothers. The financial responsibility of the family then fell on Sapna's shoulders, forcing her to take on odd jobs to support her 9th and 6th grade brothers. Starting as a caretaker at the age of 14, she worked at a ration shop before becoming a beautician.\n\nDue to family tensions, Sapna was only able to study until grade 10, despite being a bright student and consistently ranking first in her class. Her father's dream was for her to become a doctor, but that dream was not to be. She was passionate about history and science; particularly how historical events shaped the present and future.\n\nSapna had a close relationship with her father and was treated like a princess in the family. He never differentiated between his daughter and son, a rare attribute in India where gender biases still exist. Her father's absence is deeply felt, as she now has to take care of everyone and everything. Despite this, she remains determined to support her family and make sacrifices for their well-being.\n\nHer life changed when she trained at our beauty program to become a beautician, facing challenges with the practical aspect of her training due to her being left-handed and the tools being designed for right-handed people. However, her teacher encouraged her to keep practicing and have faith in herself. She eventually found a job and continues to work hard to improve her skills.\n\nSapna believes that women can achieve anything they set their minds to and is proud to be the decision-maker of her house. She encourages more women to join our programs and lead the lives they deserve. Her aspiration is to continue growing in her field and eventually have something of her own.",
